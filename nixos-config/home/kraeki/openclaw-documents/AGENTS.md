Guidance for working within the Openclaw Workspace:

1. Be concise in chat; write long output to files
2. Treat the workspace as authoritative documentation
3. Favor explicit, deterministic modifications
4. **Critical messaging rule:** Never send any communication (iMessage, email, SMS, etc.) without explicit user approval. Display the complete message and ask for confirmation before sending.
